        opening act for successful comics Buddy Hackett and <a

    <p>In 1983 Carrey headed west to Hollywood where he starred in a made-for-television movie called
        <br>
        Introducing...Janet. Carrey's appearances on TV in programs such as The Duck Factory and Jim Carrey's Unnatural
        <br>
        Act (1991) led to a regular role on the hit comedy In Living Color.</p>
    <h3>Movies</h3>
    <p><i>'Ace Ventura: Pet Detective,' 'The Mask'</i></p>
    <p>Carrey's big screen debut came with 1984's Finders Keepers, but he didn't find success until he played the title
        <br>
        role in the 1994 comedy Ace Ventura: Pet Detective. From there, Carrey's expressive face, expert mimicry skills
        <br>
        and physical brand of comedy kept the hits coming. He followed with The Mask (1994), Dumb and Dumber (1994), Ace
        <br>
        Ventura: When Nature Calls (1995), Batman Forever (1995), The Cable Guy (1996) and Liar Liar (1997).</p>
    <p><i>'The Truman Show,' 'Man on the Moon'</i></p>
    <p>Carrey took a successful dramatic turn as Truman Burbank in Peter Weir's The Truman Show (1998), for which he won
        <br>
        a Golden Globe award for Best Actor. He then teamed up with legendary director Milos Forman for the
        <br>
        <a href="https://www.biography.com/performer/andy-kaufman">Andy Kaufman</a>
        biopic Man on the Moon (1999), co-starring <a href="https://www.biography.com/musician/courtney-love">Courtney
            Love</a>.
        <br>
        For his dead-on portrayal of Kaufman, Carrey took home
        <br>
        his second Golden Globe. Despite his Golden Globe success, he didn't earn a nomination for an Academy Award.
        <br>
        Still, he became one of the highest-paid actors in Hollywood, with an reported asking price of $20 million.</p>
    <p><i>'Me, Myself and Irene,' 'How the Grinch Stole Christmas,' 'Eternal Sunshine'</i></p>
    <p>In the summer of 2000, Carrey portrayed a character with two dueling personalities (both in love with the same
        <br>
        woman) in the comedy Me, Myself and Irene. That fall, wearing pounds of green fur and makeup, he starred as the
        <br>
        titular curmudgeon in the long-awaited big budget film version of Dr. Seuss' holiday classic, How the Grinch
        <br>
        Stole Christmas, directed by Ron Howard. In 2003 the actor starred as a man endowed with God-like powers in
        <br>
        Bruce Almighty, with Jennifer Aniston. The following year, Carrey starred opposite Kate Winslet in Charlie
        <br>
        Kaufman's Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. </p>
    <p><i>'Fun with Dick and Jane,' 'Dumb and Dumber To'</i></p>
    <p>Carrey continued to take on a variety of comedic roles, starring in such films as Fun with Dick and Jane (2005),
        <br>
        A Christmas Carol (2009) and Mr. Popper's Penguins (2011). He also enjoyed supporting parts in The Incredible
        <br>
        Burt Wonderstone (2013), with Steve Carell, and Kick Ass 2 (2013). In 2014 Carrey reteamed with Jeff Daniels for
        <br>
        Dumb and Dumber To.</p>
    <p><i>'Kidding'</i></p>
    <p>In 2018 Carrey made his way onto the small screen in the Showtime comedy series Kidding, a story about a
        <br>
        celebrated children's TV host named Jeff (aka Mr. Pickles) whose family life begins to unravel much faster than
        <br>
        he's able to handle. Prior to Kidding, Carrey was working behind the scenes on Showtime as an executive producer
        <br>
        on the dramedy I'm Dying Up Here.
        <br>
        Following a three-plus-year break from the big screen, Carrey returned in early 2020 to play the evil Dr.
        <br>
        Robotnik in an adaptation of the popular 1990s video game Sonic the Hedgehog.</p>
    <h3>Paintings</h3>
    <p>While his career as a big screen star waned, Carrey began pursuing his painting hobby in earnest. In 2017 he
        <br>
        released a six-minute documentary, I Needed Color, in which he explained his passion for art and showed off his
        <br>
        completed works.
        <br>

        In 2018 Carrey came under fire for tweeting an unflattering portrait of someone who resembled White House Press
        <br>
        Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders, with the caption, "This is the portrait of a so-called Christian whose only
        <br>
        purpose in life is to lie for the wicked. Monstrous!" A spokesperson confirmed that the piece was rendered by
        <br>
        Carrey but did not confirm whether or not Sanders was the subject.</p>
    <h3>Personal Life & Daughter</h3>
    <p>Carrey has a daughter, Jane, from his marriage to Melissa Womer (from 1987 to 1995). He was married briefly to
        <br>
        Dumb & Dumber co-star Lauren Holly before entering a yearlong romance with his Me, Myself and Irene leading lady
        <br>
        Renee Zellweger. He was later involved with actress/model Jenny McCarthy.
        <br>

        In 2015, Carrey's girlfriend, Cathriona White, died from a drug overdose in what was ruled a suicide. Both
        <br>
        White's estranged husband and mother sued Carrey for wrongful death, though the charges were eventually
        <br>
        dismissed. </p>
